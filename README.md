# React Static Portfolio Project

This is very much in-progress.

## Why am I doing this?

This is an effort to put a "portfolio site" together while brushing up on a bunch of React stuff.  I've been 100% Polymer for years.

The current version of the site: <http://www.someonewritethisdown.com>.

### TODOs

* Add tests everywhere. There are some. I'm learning that testing React components is very different from testing Polymer components.

* Put some stuff in redux state.  There's a container hooked up to fetch projects, it's just not doing anything yet.
